Have you ever thought about the volume of consumption we've been responsible for in our lives? 

I've lived for a little over 30 years and in that time, I've consumed so much. It just passes right through you or stays with you. 

Yesterday, I was struck with the ease with which I can consume cookies. Eating half a dozen chocolate chip cookies from [Tiff's Treats][0] is really, really easy for me. Others don't have this problem/ability. If you think about it, you've probably eaten a gross amount of \[fill in your vice here\] and not even thought twice about it. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/975546f6-d6e0-43cf-b05a-a273aea7d75b.jpg)

When I was young I would eat entire bags of Mothers Coconut Cookies. Today, I can eat a sleeve of Oreo's without blinking. 

To start I estimated that I've eaten 10,000 cookies in my lifetime. But then I started to break that down.

> 10000 / 30 years = 333 cookies per year

Nearly one cookie per day seems excessive and incorrect; however, I rarely eat one cookie at a time. Yesterday for example, I ate 4 cookies while I was driving to a hookah bar. 
> 
> 333 cookies / 4 cookies per sitting = 83 days of cookies

![The standard 14.3 oz package of Oreos contains 36 cookies!](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/771a01b1f52ce752152fe15de826b193dc8fb20c.jpg)

Do I really eat cookies 1.6 times a week? Do I really only eat 4 cookies when I sit down to eat cookies?

If I bought a package of Oreos tomorrow, I can guarantee, by the weekend, those cookies would be gone. **That's 36 cookies in less than a week!**

That makes me think 10,000 is a very low estimate.

There are more productive things you can apply this to in your life. It seems trivial when applied to cookies. But think about all you've done in your life and the impact you've had on yourself as a result. How many people have you kissed? How many times have you given to charity? How many times have you helped a neighbor? How many times have you called your parents? How many times did you drink a beer? How many times did you not eat leftovers? 

Food for thought.
